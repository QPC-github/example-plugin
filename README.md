Its examples are out of date and no longer useful.
There are plenty of up-to-date examples of how to use the current Pants plugin API
in the main [Pants repo](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants), particularly
in the various standard [backends](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/main/src/python/pants/backend).
You can also learn more on the [documentation site](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/plugins-overview),
and we're happy to answer questions on [Slack](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/getting-help).
